PROJECT TITLE: Spider Chase
AUTHORS: Harry Robinson 22787039
USER INSTRUCTIONS: 

I decided to challenge myself and turn this project into a platformer game, so there are some additions to note.

PLAYER CONTROLS:

up, space or  'w': jump

left or a: move left

right or d: move right

down: drop down

Player controls a daring ant venturing into a spider's den to eat her vulnerable young.

The player can jump and land on platforms made of dessicated spider-victims, but will fall to the bottom of screen if unsupported.

The juvenile spiders will move back and forth randomly on their starting platforms, until eaten or destroyed.

The mother spider will roam erratically, avoiding platforms and will seek the player when in range.If platforms block the spider's 
movement path, it will demolish them to go through.

If a juvenile spider has no platform left to move on, it will die.

WIN CONDITIONS:

The game is won only when the player has eaten all 10 of the young.

The game is lost if the spider catches the player.

If less than 10 food was eaten, but none remains, then the game ends with survival as consolation.

UI:

There are labels at the top of screen to track both the food consumed and the amount of jumps taken in the playthrough.

Upon game end, the screen displays a game over message, and these stats remain for the player to view.
